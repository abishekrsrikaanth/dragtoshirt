DragToShirt is a jQuery plugin that allows you to easily turn a web page into a t-shirt shop. It uses the Spreadshirt api, and allows your visitors to drag images from your site onto t-shirts to generate a product that they can then buy. This is very convenient if you have, for example, an online gallery and you want to make money by making commissions from t-shirt sales. It's designed to be easy to use, customizable, and not require any changes to your current web page design.

For documentation on how to use it and a demonstration see http://dragtoshirt.appspot.com
